	// an arbitrary number of passes to use to attempt to render a transparent scene
	// as accurately as possible. It is not reccomended that you use this object
	// as a generic group, as the children you add will be deleted every time
	// dirty() is called.
	//
	// This object will create $numPasses RTT cameras and a single "composite" 
	// camera and add them as required to itself. There is currently no support
	// for stretching an RTT stack internally to fit a viewport that isn't a 
	// 1:1 ratio of texture:view dimensions. This could be achieved by modifying
	// the CullCallback.
	//
	// Note that while we need to create a color buffer for each peel/pass, we can
	// optimize by only using two depth buffers; modulo-ing (for lack of a better word)
	// ourselves by using one-or-the-other for each pass.
